# CPSC4910
CPSC 4910 / Seminar in Professional Issues II / Clemson University / Herzog / Fall 2017

In this project, we will be implementing a prototype of a web app that allows a user (e.g. a student in a dining hall) to input their phone number, build a sandwich, and eventually be notified when that sandwich has been prepared. Another user (e.g. a dining hall employee who will be making the sandwich) will be able to view the contents of that sandwich and notify the user who submitted the order after it has been prepared.

We will be using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP code to implement this prototype. 

We will be following Google's Style Guides, which can be found here: https://google.github.io/styleguide/.

Our app is currently being hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. Feel free to check out our current progress at http://54.200.82.249/cpsc4910/student/index.html. (Last updated 11/10/17)
